=head1 NAME

Text::Phonetic::Metaphone - Metaphone algorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Metaphone was developed by Lawrence Philips as a response to deficiencies in 
the Soundex algorithm. It is more accurate than Soundex because it uses a 
larger set of rules for English pronunciation. (Wikipedia, 2007)

This module is a thin wrapper arround L<Text::Metaphone>.

The parameter C<max_length> can be set to limit the length of the encoded 
string.
